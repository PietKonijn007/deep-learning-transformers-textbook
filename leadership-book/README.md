# Deep Learning and LLMs for Technical Leaders

A comprehensive guide for CTOs, Engineering Leaders, and Technical Decision-Makers navigating the AI transformation.

## Overview

This book adapts the technical foundations from "Deep Learning and Transformers" into a leadership-focused resource. It bridges the gap between technical understanding and strategic decision-making for leaders who need to:

- Evaluate AI/ML technologies and vendors
- Build and scale AI teams
- Make informed architectural decisions
- Understand cost, performance, and risk tradeoffs
- Lead AI transformation initiatives

## Target Audience

- CTOs and VP Engineering
- Technical Directors and Engineering Managers
- Product Leaders working with AI
- Technical Architects evaluating AI solutions
- Founders building AI-powered products

## Book Structure

The book is organized into strategic sections:

1. **Foundations for Leaders** - Essential technical concepts without deep math
2. **Architecture & Infrastructure** - System design, scaling, and deployment
3. **Team & Organization** - Building AI teams, hiring, and culture
4. **Strategy & Execution** - Roadmaps, vendor evaluation, and ROI
5. **Industry Applications** - Real-world case studies and patterns
6. **Risk & Governance** - Security, ethics, compliance, and monitoring

## Build System

Like the original book, this uses:
- LaTeX for source content
- PDF generation via pdflatex
- HTML conversion for web deployment
- Shared nodejs-version site for hosting both books
